## Getting Started

### About this
I made this as a fun way of understanding the new fetch API and loading images after initially loading a thumbnail image. 

I also make use of debouncing to prevent browser lag when the page is scrolled and scrolling to the bottom allows for more images to be loaded.

Just some holiday hacking.
