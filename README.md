![RedFetch Logo](/images/redfetch.png "RedFetch Logo")

## Getting Started
I made this as a fun way of understanding the new [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and loading images after initially loading a thumbnail image.

There are other reddit image viewers out there that offer more functionality, but I found that all I wanted to do was browse through the images, so I made something that does just that. 

It seems faster than other sites so far and performs well on mobile.

I also make use of debouncing to prevent browser lag when the page is scrolled and scrolling to the bottom allows for more images to be loaded.

## Issues
* Does not support gyfcat images pulled from reddit.

## Contributing
I do not accept contributions to this project, it is a personal project that I intend to update myself in the future, however please feel free to make an issue with a suggested feature you might like.

Please note that I intend to keep this application light weight so fully fledged login based operations may not be supported at all in the future.
